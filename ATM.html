    <h2>8th Grade Learning</h2>
    <p>I plan on becoming an Artist Manager. I am already a good friend of a Artist Manager names Val Perre. He manages some of my favorite artists. I know it will be fun because you get to go to each show around the country and the partying and how much fun you would have. I look forward to it greatly.

        <h2>Reflection of the Program</h2>
        <p> My academic goals are to be able to finish each school year with a 3.6+ GPA. Also my goals in life are to be able to have a career where I don’t regret a day of working there. Also I want to be financially stable in terms If i were to have kids(I doubt) I wouldn’t stress at the end of the day.</p>
