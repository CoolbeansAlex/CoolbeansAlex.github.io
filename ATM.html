        <h2> Hour of Code</h2>
        <img src="images/BeeCode.jpg" width=300>
        <p> In 6th grade, I was introduced to Code, and in the "Hour of Code", it gave me a great oppurtunity to chose a fun creature to create from scratch. I stuck with something simple but eye pleasing. Coding was a bit difficult, but the outcome of coding is definitely worth it!</P>

        <h2> 7th Grade Photoshop</h2>
        <img src="images/5olivashells copy.jpg" width=300>
        <p> PhotoShop is by far my favorite unit in ATM because editing photos, of course more complex than the photo I first Photoshopped above. It has tons of creative tools availiable to make photos completely different and however you want to tweak it.</p>
        <h2> Filming <h2>
            <p> I really enjoyed this unit. It made me realize that is actually is kinda fun. I learned new ways to film, like shoulder shots, etc.</p>

              <h2> Alpaca Video </h2>
              <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t835cYz9crF8cLzZgPiwq07hPSA0t-B6/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
              <p> I added my own sounds to the Alpaca video. Before I was given this assignment ther was no audio inside the video. </P>
        <h2>Reflection of the Program</h2>
        <p> Since I started ATM, to the point Iâ€™m at now, I feel way more comfortable around computers, and don't need a lot of help with computers when I type essays, powerpoints, etc. I had never realized how fun coding and created websites were. Now I am more free to do these things on my own, and can do it when Im bored.
